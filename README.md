# App Metrics 1.0 Documentation Site
This repo contains the docfx generated site for https://alhardy.github.io/app-metrics-docs/  which is the documentation for App Metrics 1.0.

Documentation should not be edited here, to contribute see the [AppMetrics.DocFx](https://github.com/alhardy/AppMetrics.DocFx) repo

# App Metrics 2.0 Documentation Site

Now using Hugo for site generation, you can find the source [here](https://github.com/AppMetrics/Docs.V2.Hugo). This repo no longer hosts the documentation site, it has moved to netlify.
